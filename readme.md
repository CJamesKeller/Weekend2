## Description

 This is a jQuery calculator. I worked to try to get the code to follow order
 of operations and take in which button was clicked based on the data tags.

 The code does not perform all functionality I hoped to bring in, but the code
 itself shows how I attempted to do this, mainly using quite a few functions
 in a chain that determine what to do based on switch statements. The
 calculator looks good visually.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install`, then `npm start`.
